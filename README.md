# TSP Solver using GA

TSP Solver application using a genetic algorithm to find the shortest path.

The genetic algorithm uses different operators for crossover and mutation,
and other parameters that can be set for the user.

The program was designed to compare results between different parameters
for a genetic algorithm, and to demonstrate an application to solve a problem
in a more effective an efficient way.

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1
